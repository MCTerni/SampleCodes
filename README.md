# SampleCodes
Those are some samples of codes representative of my job.

    Java - it is the most current job I did professionally. I refactored part of a code that used to be repeated, almost entirely, in 4 different classes.  The goal was extract a method to be used for the 4 original classes. The original 4 classes were 4 different UIs, 2 of them used to generate individual customer reports, and the other 2 to generate the same reports for multiple customers. In the end I not only could extract the method as required, as I also could reduce the number of UIs for 2, one for the individual generation and other for the multiple generation because  the type of report is now dynamically defined. I still see a lot of potential improvements for those classes, but the idea at this moment was extract a common method without change anything outside those 4 classes.


    Python crud - it is a CRUD I made for one of my courses in the last semester of the college. It was the first time I coded in Python, as the idea of that course was learn a new programming language. That is a good example how I approach new technologies. I used Django as the framework for this project.


    ReactJS - src - it is the src folder of a React.js page I created for a Shopify challenge and it is a good piece of portfolio, as it represents my approach to Front End development with o modern framework, that I have been studying for the last 6 months.
